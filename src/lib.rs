//! This library provides an efficient implementation of [Wavelet Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_Tree).
//!
//! A wavelet tree [[1](#bib)] is a compact data structure that for a text of length
//! $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ requires only $n\lceil\log \sigma \rceil (1+o(1))$
//! bits of space and can answer `rank` and `select` queries in $\Theta(\log \sigma)$ time.
//!
//! Given a static sequence `S[0,n-1]`, a wavelet tree indexes the sequence `S` and
//! supports three operations:
//! - `get(i)` returns S[i];
//! - `rank(c, i)` returns the number of occurrences of the symbol `c` in the prefix S[0...i-1];
//! - `select(c, i)` returns the position in S of the `i`th occurrence of the symbol `c`.
//!  
//! Our implementation of Wavelet Tree improves query performance by using a 4-ary
//! tree instead of a binary tree as the basis of the wavelet tree.
//! The 4-ary tree layout of a wavelet tree helps to halve the number of cache misses
//! during queries and thus reduces the query latency. This way we are roughly 2 times
//! faster than other existing implementations (e.g., SDSL).
